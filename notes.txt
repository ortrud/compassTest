### Visualize Winning Numbers

1. Load the data async into the application and format the data to make it possible to visualize and manipulate in the code
2. Aggregate each number from the "Winning Numbers" column and display the numbers in descending order with the number and the occurrences.
3. Add a limit to only show top 10, 20.
4. Add filters to limit the results to a given year
5. Add sorting to sort by occurrences or winning number

### Package it in a Docker container
- There should be a Dockerfile coming with your solution that would contain application running on port 4000. 
- It should accept the CSV URL as an environment variable named DATA_URL

## Evaluation

### What we will be looking at:
1. Solution should be correct, for any output (not just the one we specify by default)
2. Scalability. What if the file downloaded is huge?
3. Error handling (all sorts of)
4. Testing
5. Documentation
6. Best practices, project layout, etc
